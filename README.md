# Covid Museum

This directory contains some initial thoughts for the
Covid Museum.  I expect this will be moved to a repo
dedicated to this project soon.

For UML documents, .uxf diagrams are created with
Umlet - https://www.umlet.com/.  Diagrams are exported to
SVG format.  Umlet is simple, free, and has been stable
for years.

Retext seems to work OK for Markdown editing/preview.
